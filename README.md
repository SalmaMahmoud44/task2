# task2

I am happy to share my second task during the CodSoft internship! ðŸŽ‰

In this task, I worked on designing an email template with a focus on making it responsive to function perfectly across all devices. ðŸ“§âœ¨

I thoroughly enjoyed designing this template, and it was an experience filled with learning and development in the field of UI/UX design. ðŸš€ðŸŽ¨
